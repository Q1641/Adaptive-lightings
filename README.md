# Adaptive-lightings
 This is my very first dabble into genetic algorithm; therefore the actual code itself has plenty of room to improve.
 
 This algorithm is based entirely on a paper published by Assoc. Prof. Nguyen Hoai Son and his accomplishes at University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University. Please refer to [this paper](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/~sonnh/data/papers/Adaptive_smart_lighting.APCC2019.pdf) for more details about the algorithm and actual performance test results.
 
 This project is unlikely to receive any new updates in the foreseeable future
 
## Introduction
 This algorithm aims to finds the best lighting patterns to optimize lightings for its users and minimize energy consumption.
 The sensors would return the lightings in each area, which allows us to calculate natural lighting at each locations.
 The user would input their desirable illumination at each area.
 Based on natural lightings, this algorithm would search for a way to suppliment artificial lightings to best meet the user's demand

## How to make use of this project?
 This segment is mostly for documentation only. Actual usage of this code is not encouraged.
 
 This project utilises a lot of global variables, all of which is located at data.h. You can manually change them or automized the process for larger inputs.
